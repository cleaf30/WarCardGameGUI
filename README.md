# WarCardGameGUI
  Simulates the card game war with the computer.
A deck of card is shuffled and dealt.
The player and the computer both take a card off the top and flip it over.
Whoever has the the higher ranking card wins and takes both cards (Aces high).
If both cards are of the same rank each player puts a card face down and then another card face up.
Whoever has the higher face up card wins all the cards.
If its a tie it happens again until someone wins.
If someone runs out of cards at any point they loose.
